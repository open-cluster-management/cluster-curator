# Debugging the Cluster-Curator-Controller

After you make your changes you actually need to build your own image because when the curator code creates a Job CR, the Job will load its own cluster-curator-controller image to run the curator binary. Make sure docker is started.

1. export REPO_URL=<your_quay_url> ie. quay.io/<user_name>
2. export VERSION=<image_tag>
3. make build-curator<br>
   For podman users:<br>
   `podman build -f Dockerfile.prow . -t ${REPO_URL}/cluster-curator-controller:${VERSION}`
4. docker push <REPO_URL>/cluster-curator-controller:\<VERSION>

## Building with docker

Docker changed the `FROM` command to pull images based on your machine arch ie. for Mac it will use arm64. This will cause the docker build to fail because it will try to look for a arm64 arch in a linux image. To build locally, you need to modify the `Dockerfile.prow` `FROM` commands with this `--platform=linux/amd64`. For example:

```
FROM --platform=linux/amd64 registry.ci.openshift.org/stolostron/builder:go1.21-linux as builder

...

FROM --platform=linux/amd64 registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal:latest
```

## Debugging locally in VSCode

If you are debugging locally then you need to do the following:
1. oc login to the cluster
2. Stop the curator running on the cluster by first scaling down the `multicluster-engine-operator` pods and then the `cluster-curator-controller` pods
3. Add the IMAGE_URI env var pointing to the image you just pushed in the VSCode launch.json. If you don’t do this then it will just load the latest image which will not contain your changes

Example launch.json:
```json
{
 "version": "0.2.0",
 "configurations": [
   {
     "name": "Launch",
     "type": "go",
     "request": "launch",
     "mode": "debug",
     "program": "${workspaceRoot}/cmd/manager",
     "env": {
       "WATCH_NAMESPACE": "",
       "IMAGE_URI": "quay.io/<user_name>/cluster-curator-controller@sha256:ce527566269f4bffad08ae8eb8533c9f829406d8bfc09299f4a84fe5492666b5"
     },
     "args": [],
     "showLog": true
   }
 ]
}
```

When using breakpoints in VSCode you can only debug up to https://github.com/stolostron/cluster-curator-controller/blob/main/pkg/controller/launcher/job.go. For the code after that point, you still need to do scaffolding ie. use log or printf statements to debug because that code is called by the Job CRs which we can’t step through using VSCode.

## Patching the hub cluster
To patch the hub cluster you need to find the multicluster-engine `clusterserviceversion` or CSV. The easiest way I find is to look at the installed operators in the OCP console. Click on the multicluster-engine and select the YAML tab.

Find the two image instances of the cluster-curator-controller and point to the one you built.

```
- image: >-
        quay.io/<user_name>/cluster-curator-controller@sha256:0df33edc4662906bed71a52301597774a420e0c51bd58ec70c5a7f7600380f18
```

After some time the multicluster-engine-operator will reconcile and pick up the new image. If you scaled down the multicluster-engine-operator earlier, you need to scale up to two pods again.

Once the new pods are deployed. If you also changed the CRD then you need to `oc apply` the new CRD. 
#### Note, you will need to re-apply the CRD every time the multicluster-engine-operator reconciles which means every time you point to a newer image.
